# Overview of the Arduino Components

## Introduction

Different components on the Arduino board, are discussed here. We will study the Arduino UNO board because it is the most popular board in the Arduino board family. In addition, it is the best board to get started with electronics and coding. Some boards look a bit different from the one given below, but most Arduinos have majority of these components in common.

## Explanation

Looking at the board from the top down, this is an outline of what you will see (parts of the board you might interact with in the course of normal use are highlighted):

Starting clockwise from the top center:
- Analog Reference pin (orange)  
- Digital Ground (light green)  
- Digital Pins 2-13 (green)
- Digital Pins 0-1/Serial In/Out - TX/RX (dark green) - These pins cannot be used for digital i/o (digitalRead and digitalWrite) if you are also using serial communication (e.g. Serial.begin).  
- Reset Button - S1 (dark blue)  
- In-circuit Serial Programmer (blue-green)  
- Analog In Pins 0-5 (light blue)  
- Power and Ground Pins (power: orange, grounds: light orange)  
- External Power Supply In (9-12VDC) - X1 (pink)  
- Toggles External Power and USB Power (place jumper on two pins closest to desired supply) - SV1 (purple)  
- USB (used for uploading sketches to the board and for serial communication between the board and the computer; can be used to power the board) (yellow)

## Digital Pins

Digital pins on an Arduino board can be used for general input and output via the pinMode(), digitalRead(), and digitalWrite() commands, each with a 40 mA current limit and internal pull-up resistors.  

- **Serial (0 RX, 1 TX):** Used for receiving and transmitting TTL serial data.  
- **External Interrupts (2, 3):** Can trigger interrupts on various signal changes using attachInterrupt().  
- **PWM (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11):** Provide 8-bit PWM output via analogWrite().  
- **BT Reset (7):** Resets the BluetoothÂ® module (Arduino BT only).  
- **SPI (10 SS, 11 MOSI, 12 MISO, 13 SCK):** Support SPI communication.  
- **LED (13):** Built-in LED that turns on when the pin is HIGH and off when the pin is LOW.  

## Analog Pins

Analog pins on an Arduino board support 10-bit analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) using the analogRead() function. Most analog inputs can also function as digital pins, with analog input 0 corresponding to digital pin 14 through analog input 5 as digital pin 19. Analog inputs 6 and 7, available on the Mini and BT, cannot be used as digital pins.    
- **I2C (4 SDA, 5 SCL):** Support I2C communication via the Wire library.

## Power Pins

- **VIN:** The input voltage pin for external power sources, used when not powered via USB. Voltage can be supplied through this pin or accessed if using the power jack. Note that voltage requirements vary by board, and the LilyPad does not have a VIN pin.  
- **5V:** The regulated power supply for the microcontroller and other components, derived from VIN via an on-board regulator or supplied by USB/regulated 5V source.  
- **3V3:** (Diecimila-only) A 3.3V supply generated by the on-board FTDI chip.  
- **GND:** Ground pins.  

## Some other Pins

- AREF. Reference voltage for the analog inputs. Used with analogReference().  
- Reset. (Diecimila-only) Bring this line LOW to reset the microcontroller. Typically used to add a reset button to shields which block the one on the board.
